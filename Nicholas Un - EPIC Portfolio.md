## EPIC Experience
- Software Engineering I - Data Structures
- Software Engineering II - Capstone.
### Data Structures
* In this course, we learned about different types of data structures. Examples include Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Trees, and Heaps.
* While practicing our coding skills by creating these data types, we needed to collaborate, communicate, think critically, and act in a professional manner with our peers.

### Capstone
* In this course, we practiced putting out Java knowledge to use in making Software and Web-Based Applications.
* In doing these projects, we collaborated, thought critically and creatively, and worked in a professional manner.
### Workforce Readiness
- I learned how to be more open with peers in a collaborative environment, as well as practised professional communicating using body language and proper tone.
### Professional Experiences
